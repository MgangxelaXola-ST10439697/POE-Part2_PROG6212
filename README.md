Contract Monthly Claim System – Part 2 Summary

For Part 2 of my PROG6212 project, I improved my Contract Monthly Claim System to turn the basic prototype from Part 1 into a fully working web application. I connected the system to a SQL Server LocalDB database using Entity Framework Core, which now saves all the lecturer claims directly to the database. I created a functional claim submission form where lecturers can enter their name, hours worked, hourly rate, and notes, and upload a supporting document such as a PDF, Word, or Excel file. The uploaded files are stored safely in the “uploads” folder and linked to each claim record. I also added an approval feature so that programme coordinators can view all claims and either approve or reject them, which updates the claim status automatically. The user interface was redesigned using Bootstrap to look cleaner and easier to navigate, with new pages for Home, Submit, History, Upload, and Login. I added simple login logic so that lecturers and coordinators can test different views, and included basic validation and error handling to make the system more reliable. Finally, I added a small test project using xUnit to check that claim submission and approval work correctly. Overall, Part 2 now has a connected database, working forms, file uploads, approvals, and a more polished and professional layout compared to Part 1.
